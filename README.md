### Used
What blockchain advocates can learn from the internet revolution (interesting read on what people think who do not realize most of the blockchain world is open source and free to use; internet development went different with different standards and proprietary applications)

In my view an imporant piece; one of those things I've been trying to wrap my head around: what happens if al this stored information makes it all too easy for totalitarian states and the likes?

Online magazine on ICO's. But be warned: many pieces are written by the authors of the respective tokens/coins/companies

## Own work
For me this was the piece which tought me a lot. When reading it now, I see flaws in ease of explanation, but that's a learning curve:
