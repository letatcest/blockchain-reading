# The Blockchain Reading List
### Found a great resource for the newsletter or just reading? Add it by submitting a Pull Request!
This repository is partly for me to memorize which articles I used in my newsletter and to be used as a better way to memorize what I consider interesting thoughts on blockchain. 

| [Basics](#basics) | [Projects for the good](#projects-for-the-good) | [Background](#background) | [Governing](#governing) | [Newsletter](#newsletter) | [Interesting IRL gatherings](#interesting-irl-gatherings) | [Own work](#own-work) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

## Basics
- [Bitcoin like I'm five](https://medium.com/@nik5ter/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833)
- Ethereum-basics: [Ethereum Reading List](https://github.com/Scanate/Ethlist). Yes, I copied this initiative a bit.
- [Lightning network](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/the-lightning-network-elidhdicacs) A way to create fast payments, but trust is extended..

## Projects for the good
- Funds! From NGO-like orgasations, always nice. This is the Dutch regulatory group for the NL-domain SIDN. Select 'blockchain' from the Theme-tab:
https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten/ (Newsletter [#1](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/krijnsoeteman/issues/blockchain-nieuwsbrief-issue-1-65631))

## Background
- Although I think I explained Ethereum at length in Dutch in July 2016, this it what Motherboard wrote a year after:
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/newkqz/okay-wtf-is-ethereum
- Why are there so many large investments? Maybe because there are too many rich crypto kids on the block?
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/crypto-investing-age-whales/ (Newsletter [#1](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/krijnsoeteman/issues/blockchain-nieuwsbrief-issue-1-65631))
- In my view an imporant piece; one of those things I've been trying to wrap my head around: what happens if al this stored information makes it all too easy for totalitarian states and the likes? 
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/blockchain-of-command/528543/ (Newsletter [#1](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/krijnsoeteman/issues/blockchain-nieuwsbrief-issue-1-65631))
- What blockchain advocates can learn from the internet revolution (interesting read on what people think who do not realize most of the blockchain world is open source and free to use; internet development went different with different standards and proprietary applications)
https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/07/11/what-blockchain-advocates-can-learn-from-the-internets-evolution/ (Newsletter [#1](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/krijnsoeteman/issues/blockchain-nieuwsbrief-issue-1-65631)) 

## Governing
### Goverments
- Governments are pretty intersted in Blockchain. For the good, but maybe not?..

### Finance
See: [Concise ICO outline](/ico.md) for more ICO-information
- [IBM predicts the global blockchain market will grow to 5.43 billion USD by 2023. 91 percent of banks plan to invest in blockchain by 2018](https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=GBE03842USEN&)
- [1.3 billion raised by ICO's since Januari 2017 (now: Juli 18)](https://www.ft.com/content/1a164d6c-6b12-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa)
- Online magazine on ICO's. But be warned: many pieces are written by the authors of the respective tokens/coins/companies

## Newsletter

### Proposed
- I searched and search and.. I read it on my Phone in Firefox (which I use because I can use Ghostery on FF on my phone) fortunately that one syncs as well: read. https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-the-blockchain-1da89ba19348

- Bitcoin op 1 augustus: UASF & SegWit2X - Wat, wanneer & waarom (great piece in Dutch on what might be expected on the first of August)

- Nice explanation from Lykle de Vries and Rutger van Zuidam on how blockchains work (mainly Bitcoin) at a meetup from my old employer Tweakers
https://tweakers.net/plan/1301/bekijk-de-presentaties-van-de-meet-up-blockchain.html

- Although it talks about blockchain from an investors perspective, it explains why blockchain will yield more small businesses, because of the protocol layer is the biggest asset: https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/a-brief-history-of-blockchain-an-investors-perspective-387c440ad11c

- Following up on that, this article on TUI's own private blockchain for reservations etc. will eventually connect to a public blockchain for travel reservations. Notable quote: 
> Blockchain is essentially a large database, where querying a hotel in Berlin might return 800 properties. Search companies would most likely still operate to help users find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for and offer a curated list of hotels.

> What would change, however, is the barrier to entry for startups as anyone would be able to source rooms from the blockchain and thereby the market would see increased competition rather than intermediaries setting the distribution rates.

September 28: [Dutch Blockchain Hackathon](https://blockchainhackathon.eu/events/co-create-the-next-operating-system-for-our-societ)


## Own work
- For me this was the piece which tought me a lot. When reading it now, I see flaws in ease of explanation, but that's a learning curve:

Wrote a lot more on blockchain related stuff between March 2015 and October 2016 on this website, but most articles were just news. (Newsletter [#1](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/krijnsoeteman/issues/blockchain-nieuwsbrief-issue-1-65631))

- On ICO's and why they are different than IPO's
