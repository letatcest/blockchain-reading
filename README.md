# The Blockchain Reading List
### Found a great resource for the newsletter or just reading? Add it by submitting a Pull Request!
This repository is partly for me to memorize which articles I used in my newsletter and to be used as a better way to memorize what I consider interesting thoughts on blockchain. 

| [Basics](#basics) | [Projects for the good](#projects-for-the-good) | [Background](#background) | [Governing](#governing) | [Newsletter](#newsletter) | [Interesting IRL gatherings](#interesting-irl-gatherings) | [Own work](#own-work) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

## Basics
- [Bitcoin like I'm five](https://medium.com/@nik5ter/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833)
- Ethereum-basics: [Ethereum Reading List](https://github.com/Scanate/Ethlist). Yes, I copied this initiative a bit.
- [Lightning network](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/the-lightning-network-elidhdicacs) A way to create fast payments, but trust is extended..

## Projects for the good
- http://publicism.nl/

## Background
- Although I think I explained Ethereum at length in Dutch in July 2016, this it what Motherboard wrote a year after:
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/newkqz/okay-wtf-is-ethereum

## Governing
### Goverments
- Governments are pretty intersted in Blockchain. For the good, but maybe not?..

### Finance
See: [Concise ICO outline](/ico.md) for more ICO-information
- [IBM predicts the global blockchain market will grow to 5.43 billion USD by 2023. 91 percent of banks plan to invest in blockchain by 2018](https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=GBE03842USEN&)
- [1.3 billion raised by ICO's since Januari 2017 (now: Juli 18)](https://www.ft.com/content/1a164d6c-6b12-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa)

## Newsletter

### Proposed
- Bitcoin op 1 augustus: UASF & SegWit2X - Wat, wanneer & waarom (great piece in Dutch on what might be expected on the first of August)
https://rannasha.tweakblogs.net/blog/14975/bitcoin-op-1-augustus-uasf-en-segwit2x-wat-wanneer-en-waarom

- Own work on ICO's
http://www.ksoeteman.nl/2017/07/het-ontstaan-van-een-nieuw-soort-geldmachines-de-ico/

- Nice explanation from Lykle de Vries and Rutger van Zuidam on how blockchains work (mainly Bitcoin) at a meetup from my old employer Tweakers
https://tweakers.net/plan/1301/bekijk-de-presentaties-van-de-meet-up-blockchain.html


### Used
- What blockchain advocates can learn from the internet revolution (interesting read on what people think who do not realize most of the blockchain world is open source and free to use; internet development went different with different standards and proprietary applications)
https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/07/11/what-blockchain-advocates-can-learn-from-the-internets-evolution/

- In my view an imporant piece; one of those things I've been trying to wrap my head around: what happens if al this stored information makes it all too easy for totalitarian states and the likes? 
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/blockchain-of-command/528543/

- Why are there so many large investments? Maybe because there are too many rich crypto kids on the block?
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/crypto-investing-age-whales/

- Online magazine on ICO's. But be warned: many pieces are written by the authors of the respective tokens/coins/companies
https://issuu.com/icocrowd/docs/ico_crowd_-_issuu

- Funds! From NGO-like orgasations, always nice. This is the Dutch regulatory group for the NL-domain SIDN. Select 'blockchain' from the Theme-tab:
https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten/

- And one of my own, the big The DAO piece on Tweakers:
https://tweakers.net/reviews/4437/all/the-dao-blockchains-en-ethereum.html

## Interesting IRL gatherings
- Every first Wednesday of the month there's a meetup in Amsterdam called [Bitcoin Wednesday](bitcoinwednesday.com)
September 28: [Dutch Blockchain Hackathon](https://blockchainhackathon.eu/events/co-create-the-next-operating-system-for-our-societ)


## Own work
- For me this was the piece which tought me a lot. When reading it now, I see flaws in ease of explanation, but that's a learning curve:
https://tweakers.net/reviews/4437/all/the-dao-blockchains-en-ethereum.html
Wrote a lot on blockchain related stuff between March 2015 and October 2016 on this website, but most articles were just news.

- On ICO's and why they are different than IPO's
http://www.ksoeteman.nl/2017/07/het-ontstaan-van-een-nieuw-soort-geldmachines-de-ico/

- Thoughts in May 2015. When a fee was still low:
